BUGS:
+ `N', `X' and other `0' characters must be handled properly.
  One possible solution could be to to split the sequences in segments.
  This could also be useful for the filtering.

FEATURES:
+ Filtering (see how blast does it).
+ The SaftHNodes could be allocated by blocks instead on one by one.
